This project was a group project, done from scratch in a stack of our choice.
The front and backend are collected here for my own convenience, but to see 
git history and development process, see the two original repositories:

Backend: https://github.com/kaelynhughes/dronecones-api

Frontend: https://github.com/Bard4Dayz/dronecones-frontend-requiem
